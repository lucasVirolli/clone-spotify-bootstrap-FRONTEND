  It was a class that I've learned about Bootstrap in a course on the 'Udemy Courses', called "Desenvolvimento Web Completo 2022 - 20 cursos + 20 projetos"
  made by the developers and mentors: </br>
  - Jorge Sant Ana 🧙‍♂️ </br>
  - Jamilton Damasceno 🧙‍♂️</br>
  I totally recommend this course if you have pressed the button start 🎮 as I did recently to enter this programming world. Link below:

### But what I could learn and put in practice here?
  They used the Bootstrap version 4 in the classes, when I did this class I used Bootsrap v5.1.3 that change some things like the name of the classes on HTML, the codes on JS 
 changed to make the carousel, so was necessary look the documentation of Bootstrap and see what changed.
