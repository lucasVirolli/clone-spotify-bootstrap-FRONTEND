  It was a class that I learned about Bootstrap in a course on the 'Udemy Courses', called "Desenvolvimento Web Completo 2022 - 20 cursos + 20 projetos" (Complete Web Development 2022 - 20 courses + 20 projects) done by the developers and mentors: </br>

  - Jamilton Damasceno 🧙‍♂️</br>
  I totally recommend this course if you have pressed the button start 🎮 as I did recently to enter this programming world. Link below:

### What have I learned and put into practice here?
  They used the Bootstrap version 4 in the classes, but when I took them I used Bootsrap v5.1.3 which had some differences like the name of the Classes on HTML, the codes on JS 
 were different to make the carousel, so it was necessary to look at the documentation of Bootstrap and see what changed.
